Max/MSP patches for music theory and fun

Overview

These are patches for Max/MSP that I wrote to help me teach music theory concepts. Some are meant for basic pedagogy, some for experimentation, and some verge on algorithmic composition. Most of them require the bach and cage libraries; be sure these are installed. Some of them have dependencies: these are indicated in the descriptions below.
"Semita" is a Latin word meaning "a footpath" or "a way". I hope students will be able to use these patches to find their way through music theory concepts that may at first seem difficult or challenging.

Descriptions of the Patches

modular-arithmetic.maxpat: Experiment with the concept of mod 12 arithmetic on pitch integers.

pc-intervals.maxpat: Helps to calculate intervals in post-tonal music.

pc-set-info.maxpat: An augmented pitch-class set calculator that includes much useful information.
