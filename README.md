Max/MSP patches for music theory and fun

Overview
These are patches for Max/MSP that I wrote to help me teach music theory concepts. Some are meant for basic pedagogy, some for experimentation, and some verge on algorithmic composition. Most of them require the bach and cage libraries; be sure these are installed. Some of them have dependencies: these are indicated in the descriptions below.
