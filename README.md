Max/MSP patches for music theory and fun

**Overview**

These are patches for Max/MSP that I wrote to help teach music theory concepts. Some are meant for basic pedagogy, some for experimentation, and some verge on algorithmic composition. They are really meant for my students, but anyone can download them. "Semita" is a Latin word meaning "a footpath" or "a way". I hope students will be able to use these patches to find their way through music theory concepts that may at first seem difficult or challenging.

**Dependencies**

Most of these patches require the bach/cage libraries. You can easily download them in the Max package manager.

**Descriptions of the Patches**

modular-arithmetic.maxpat: Experiment with the concept of mod 12 arithmetic on pitch integers.

pc-intervals.maxpat: Helps to calculate intervals in post-tonal music.

pc-set-info.maxpat: An augmented pitch-class set calculator that includes much useful information.
